# How to start AI self-driving car simulator
## 1. Clone this project to your computer.

## 2. Run TestSimulator.py file and open the simulator (autonomous mode) at the same time.

## Description
For the **CNN** part, we have 5 layers of convolution \
Then we have a flatten layer to flatten the feature maps into input vector for the ANN.\
For the **ANN** part, we have 4 layers of dense


:fire::fire::fire:***Fun fact about CNN***:fire::fire::fire: \
while the convolutional layers in CNN is mandatory, the pooling layers are optional. Their existence is only for reducing image size, which is unnecessary because the main point of CNN is to extract important features, which is what convolutional layers are already doing.
